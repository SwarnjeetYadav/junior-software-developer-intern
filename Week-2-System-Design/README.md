# Week 2 - Design Documentation and Architecture Planning

## Objective
Create a comprehensive technical design and architecture plan for the TeamFlow hypothetical software project.

## Work Completed
- High level system architecture
- Architectural layers and responsibilities
- Detailed component descriptions
- Module interaction scenarios
- Request and data flow design
- High level architecture and data flow diagrams
- Representative REST API interface planning
- Data model and storage design
- Technology stack choices with advantages and trade offs
- Security architecture
- Error handling and reliability approach
- Deployment and environment plan
- Scalability and maintainability considerations
- Requirement to architecture traceability
- Architecture decision record summary

## Proposed Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js and Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- API: REST with JSON
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
- API Testing: Postman or equivalent

## Key Design Decision
The system uses a layered client server architecture. The React client communicates with a Node.js and Express REST API over HTTPS. The backend applies authentication, authorization, validation and business logic before reading or updating MongoDB. Important actions are recorded in activity history.

## Deliverables
- Week 2 design document in DOCX
- Architecture diagram
- Data flow diagram
- Weekly design record
- Requirement to architecture traceability

## Status
Completed
